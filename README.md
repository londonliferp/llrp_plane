# llrp_plane

This is a script which renders GTA V Race Checkpoints into the FiveM World.

## Usage
Zip up this repository and put it into your server, adding `start llrp_plane` into your server.cfg.
The client.lua file already has some predefined world co-ordinates in there, which are the locations of the checkpoints which are rendered in the sky.
You can add more onto these by simply adding additional lines, being sure to take care of formatting else the script will break.

You can confirm that this script is working by heading to LSIA and getting into any plane, eg `luxor` and staring out towards Great Ocean Highway.

## Commands
There's only one command for this script.
- /hidepaths

The name isn't obvious, but it will let you toggle all of the paths in the sky. No permissions are needed for it.
